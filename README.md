# Kyubyong/tacotron
This Repo is forked from [Kyubyong/tacotron](https://github.com/Kyubyong/tacotron), I removed the fork relationship just because I want to keep track of my small update.
Great thanks to [Kyubyong](https://github.com/Kyubyong/tacotron) for open source his Tacotron

I did name_scope & variable_scope rename for the network structure, so restore from [Pre-Trained Model](https://www.dropbox.com/s/8kxa3xh2vfna3s9/LJ_logdir.zip?dl=0) of Kyubyong will failed.
